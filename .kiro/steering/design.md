# Design Guidelines

When creating design documents:

1. **Reference, don't repeat** - Follow DRY principles by referencing requirements.md and glossary.md
2. **High-level architecture** - Show how components interact, not implementation details
3. **Component responsibilities** - Define what each component does, not how
4. **Cross-reference requirements** - Link design sections to specific requirements
5. **Delegate to subcomponents** - Point to subgem/submodule design docs for details
6. **Use diagrams** - Mermaid diagrams for architecture and data flow
7. **Keep it navigable** - Design docs should help readers find detailed information

See: `.kiro/steering/dry.md` for DRY principles
